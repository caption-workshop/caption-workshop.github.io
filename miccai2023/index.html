        <h1 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h1>
            <p align="justify">While computational methods in medical imaging have enabled us to detect and assess cancerous tumors and assist in their treatment, early detection of cancer precursors provides us with an opportunity for its early treatment and prevention. The survival rate of cancer is still low, and largely depends on the affected organ and how early it is diagnosed. The variable nature of the disease in different patients and the diverse imaging acquisition types involved for quantification of disease and treatment demands robust method designs. It is therefore critical to develop generalizable methods as part of a holistic early cancer detection ecosystem -- including 
              different data analysis methods for various modalities and optimizing cross-modality fusion for improved detection and prognosis. 
            </p>  
            <p align="justify"> The workshop invites researchers to submit their work in the field of medical imaging around the central theme of early cancer detection, and it strives to address the challenges that are required to be overcomed to translate computational methods to clinical practice through well designed, generalizable (robust), interpretable and clinically transferable methods. 
              Most current methods are developed on retrospective data that do not guarantee good representation of daily clinical procedures (e.g. domain gap). Through this workshop, we aim to identify the new ecosystem that will enable comprehensive method validation and reliability of methods, setting up a new gold standard for sample size and elaborate evaluation strategies to identify failure modes of methods when applied to real-world clinical environments.
